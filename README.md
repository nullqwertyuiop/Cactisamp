# Cactisamp
A WIP UTAU resampler in Python  
  
# Overview  
This is a resampler based on CREPE and pyWorld.  
The code will be updated as soon as a major progress is made.  
(Update July 22) I'm considering to scrap this project as it is stupidly slow and severe performance issues. I have a working prototype but the result isn't pleasing either, so nope.
